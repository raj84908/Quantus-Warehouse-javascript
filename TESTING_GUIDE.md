# üß™ Multi-Tenant Authentication - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ WHAT WE JUST IMPLEMENTED

### Authentication System ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ NextAuth.js configured with JWT sessions
- ‚úÖ Login page at `/auth/signin`
- ‚úÖ Signup page at `/auth/signup`
- ‚úÖ Automatic route protection (middleware)
- ‚úÖ Organization-based data isolation

### Database ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ 429 products migrated to first customer
- ‚úÖ All data has `organizationId`
- ‚úÖ Admin user created for first customer

---

## üß™ HOW TO TEST RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

The server should start on `http://localhost:3000`

---

### Step 2: Test Login with First Customer

1. **Open your browser**: `http://localhost:3000`

2. **You'll be redirected to login page**

3. **Login with these credentials**:
   ```
   Email: admin@firstcustomer.com
   Password: admin123
   ```

4. **After login, you should**:
   - See the dashboard
   - See all 429 products (they belong to this customer)
   - See all orders, categories, Shopify data

---

### Step 3: Test Multi-Tenant Isolation

1. **Open a new incognito/private window**

2. **Go to signup page**: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`

3. **Create a second customer**:
   ```
   Business Name: Test Company
   Your Name: Test User
   Email: test@example.com
   Password: testpass123
   Confirm Password: testpass123
   Plan: STARTER
   ```

4. **Click "Create Account"**

5. **You'll be auto-logged in and see**:
   - EMPTY dashboard (no products)
   - Fresh start for this customer
   - Can't see first customer's data!

6. **Add a test product**:
   - Go to Inventory
   - Click "Add Item"
   - Create a test product

7. **Logout and login as first customer again**:
   - You WON'T see the test product from customer 2!
   - Data is completely isolated!

---

## üîç VERIFY DATA ISOLATION

### Test in Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

1. **Open Organization table**:
   - Should see 2 rows:
     - "First Customer" (your existing customer)
     - "Test Company" (new signup)

2. **Open AuthUser table**:
   - Should see 2 users:
     - admin@firstcustomer.com (linked to First Customer)
     - test@example.com (linked to Test Company)

3. **Open Product table**:
   - 429 products with organizationId =  First Customer's ID
   - 1 product with organizationId = Test Company's ID (if you added one)

## üìã KEY FEATURES TO TEST

### ‚úÖ Authentication Flow
- [ ] Login with first customer works
- [ ] Signup creates new organization
- [ ] Auto-login after signup works
- [ ] Logout works (click logout in sidebar - we need to add this button)
- [ ] Can't access protected routes without login

### ‚úÖ Data Isolation
- [ ] Customer 1 sees only their 429 products
- [ ] Customer 2 sees empty inventory (or only their products)
- [ ] Orders are isolated by organization
- [ ] Categories are isolated
- [ ] Shopify connection is isolated

### ‚úÖ Multi-Tenancy
- [ ] Two users can be logged in simultaneously (different browsers)
- [ ] Each sees only their own data
- [ ] Creating products/orders doesn't affect other customer

## üö® IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK

### Issue: "Error loading page"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Unauthorized" error
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check .env has NEXTAUTH_SECRET
cat .env | grep NEXTAUTH_SECRET

# Should see:
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET=kS+fr/EvwjLe8kBNn4bqOAnt9Y//COEDcTcF88U4DnI=
```

### Issue: "Can't login"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify user exists in database
npx prisma studio

# Check AuthUser table
# Email: admin@firstcustomer.com should exist
```

### Issue: "See wrong data"
**Solution**:
- Logout completely
- Clear browser cookies
- Login again
- Data should be filtered correctly

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE

### 1. Add Logout Button (I'll do this next)
Currently missing a logout button in the sidebar

### 2. Update API Routes
Need to add authentication to API routes so they filter by organization:
- Products API
- Orders API
- Inventory API
- Shopify API
- etc.

### 3. Show Current User Info
Add user profile display in sidebar showing:
- User name
- Organization name
- Plan type

---

## üí° HOW THE MAGIC WORKS

### When User Logs In:
1. NextAuth checks email/password
2. Creates JWT session with `organizationId`
3. Session stored in cookie

### When User Accesses Data:
1. Middleware checks if logged in
2. API routes get `organizationId` from session
3. Database queries filtered: `WHERE organizationId = current_user_org`
4. User sees ONLY their data!

### Example (How Products Are Filtered):
```javascript
// OLD way (everyone sees everything):
const products = await prisma.product.findMany()

// NEW way (filtered by organization):
const user = await getCurrentUser()
const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
  where: { organizationId: user.organizationId }
})
```

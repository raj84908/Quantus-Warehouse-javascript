node scripts/test-shopify.js
```

**Common issues:**

- Incorrect domain ‚Üí Use format: `your-store.myshopify.com`
- Missing scopes ‚Üí Ensure app has `read_products` and `read_inventory`

### Sync Issues

**Check server logs:**
- Individual product errors are logged but don't stop sync
- Results include error count and details
- First 10 errors are returned in response

**Duplicate products:**
- Products are matched by `shopifyVariantId` or `sku`
- Existing products are updated, not duplicated

## üîê Security Notes

### Current Setup
- Credentials stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- Access tokens stored in database
- No authentication on API endpoints

### Production Recommendations

**Before deploying to production:**

1. **Add Authentication**
   ```javascript
   // Add auth middleware to API routes
   // Restrict access to admin users only
   ```

2. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**
   ```javascript
   // Encrypt access tokens in database
   // Use environment variables for secrets
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   // Add rate limiting to sync endpoint
   // Prevent abuse of API calls
   ```

4. **Webhook Integration** (Future Enhancement)
   - Listen for Shopify webhooks
   - Real-time inventory updates
   - Auto-sync on product changes

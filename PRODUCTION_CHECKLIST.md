  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```

  - Configure automatic backups (daily minimum)
  - Set up point-in-time recovery

- [ ] **Database security**
  - Create dedicated user with minimal permissions
  - Disable public access to database
  - Use connection pooling (Prisma's built-in pooler or PgBouncer)

- [ ] **Run migrations**
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- [ ] **Seed initial data**
  ```bash
  node scripts/create-admin.js
  ```

### üåê Hosting & Infrastructure

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening

- [ ] **Review SECURITY.md**
  - Implement all recommendations
  - Address known limitations

- [ ] **Configure rate limiting for production**
  - Set up Redis for distributed rate limiting

  - Error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)
  - Performance monitoring (Vercel Analytics, New Relic)
  - Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)

- [ ] **Set up logging**
  - Application logs (Winston, Pino)
  - Security event logs
  - Failed login attempt logs
  - Admin action audit trail

- [ ] **CORS configuration**
  - If using separate frontend, configure allowed origins
  - Add to `next.config.mjs` if needed

## Testing Before Go-Live

### ‚úÖ Functional Testing

  - [ ] Test products, orders, categories, people
  - [ ] Verify organization IDs in all database queries

- [ ] **Organization suspension**
  - [ ] Suspend an organization via admin panel
  - [ ] Verify suspended org cannot login
  - [ ] Reactivate and verify login works again

- [ ] **Admin panel**
  - [ ] View all organizations

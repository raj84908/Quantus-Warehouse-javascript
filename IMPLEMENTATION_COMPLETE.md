## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### 1️⃣ Test Login (First Customer)
```bash
# Server should already be running on http://localhost:3000
```

1. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll be redirected to `/auth/signin`
3. Login with:
   - Email: `admin@firstcustomer.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. You should see:
   - Dashboard with all 429 products
   - User profile in sidebar showing "Admin User"
   - Organization info showing "First Customer" (FREE Plan)
   - Logout button at bottom of sidebar

### 2️⃣ Test Multi-Tenant Isolation

1. **Open incognito/private window**
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`
3. Create second customer:
   ```
   Business Name: Test Company
   Your Name: Test User
   Email: test@example.com
   Password: testpass123
   Confirm Password: testpass123
   Plan: STARTER
   ```
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You'll be auto-logged in and see:
   - **EMPTY dashboard** (no products!)
   - User profile showing "Test User"
   - Organization info showing "Test Company" (STARTER Plan)
   - Fresh start - can't see first customer's data!

6. **Add a test product** to second customer
7. **Logout and login as first customer again**
8. Verify you **DON'T see** the test product from customer 2!

### 3️⃣ Test Logout
1. Click "Logout" button in sidebar
2. You should be redirected to `/auth/signin`
3. Session cleared successfully

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### When a User Logs In:
1. NextAuth verifies email/password against `AuthUser` table
2. JWT token created with `organizationId` embedded
3. Token stored in secure HTTP-only cookie
4. Session available throughout the app

### When a User Accesses Data:
1. Middleware checks if user is logged in
2. API routes use `getCurrentUser()` to get organization context
3. Database queries filtered: `WHERE organizationId = user.organizationId`
4. **Users only see their own organization's data!**

### Example Code:
```javascript
// OLD way (everyone sees everything):
const products = await prisma.product.findMany()

// NEW way (filtered by organization):
export const GET = withAuth(async (request, { user }) => {
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: { organizationId: user.organizationId }
  })
  return NextResponse.json(products)
})
```

# üîê ADMIN PANEL - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Built

Your Quantus Warehouse now has a **fully functional admin panel** with:

### 1. **Super Admin System**
- Separate admin authentication (not tied to any organization)
- JWT-based admin sessions
- Secure login at `/admin/login`

### 2. **Access Key System**
- Customers need a valid access key to sign up
- Keys can have usage limits and expiration dates
- Track which key was used for each organization

### 3. **Organization Management**
- View all customer organizations
- See user count, product count, order count for each
- Suspend/activate organizations
- Delete organizations (with all their data)

### 4. **Single Plan System**
- Removed plan selection from signup
- All customers get "STANDARD" plan
- Can be customized later if needed

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Admin Credentials Created

**Super Admin Login:**
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
- Email: `admin@quantus.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

‚ö†Ô∏è **CHANGE THIS PASSWORD IN PRODUCTION!**

### Step 2: Access Keys Created

Three access keys were automatically generated:
1. `QW-E45F4009BDF15987`
2. `QW-F254D3D552675EF0`
3. `QW-C871DE4C60BC826C`

These keys are **unlimited use** and **never expire**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

**Organization Model:**
```prisma
model Organization {
  plan            String   @default("STANDARD") // Single plan
  isSuspended     Boolean  @default(false)      // Suspension flag
  accessKeyUsed   String?                       // Which key used for signup
}
```

**New Models:**
```prisma
model SuperAdmin {
  email    String @unique
  password String
  name     String
}

model AccessKey {
  key          String   @unique
  isActive     Boolean
  maxUses      Int?
  currentUses  Int
  expiresAt    DateTime?
  createdBy    String?
  notes        String?
}
```

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

### Existing Customers

The existing "First Customer" organization:
- Already has STANDARD plan (automatically set)
- Not suspended
- No access key recorded (was created before key system)

### Updating Existing Orgs

If needed, run this to update existing organizations:

```javascript
// In Prisma Studio or a script:
await prisma.organization.updateMany({
  where: { plan: { not: 'STANDARD' } },
  data: { plan: 'STANDARD' }
})
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Security Considerations

1. **Change Default Admin Password**
   - Current: `Admin@123`
   - Change to strong password in production

2. **Protect Access Keys**
   - Don't commit keys to git
   - Don't share publicly
   - Rotate keys periodically

3. **Monitor Admin Access**
   - Admin token expires in 24h
   - All admin actions should be logged (future enhancement)

### Data Safety

1. **Deletion is Permanent**
   - No soft delete
   - No backup/restore (yet)
   - Always confirm before deleting

2. **Suspension is Reversible**
   - Use suspension for temporary issues
   - Use deletion only when necessary

### Performance

1. **Pagination** (Future)
   - Currently loads all orgs
   - Add pagination when > 100 orgs

2. **Search** (Future)
   - Add search/filter for organizations
   - Filter by plan, status, date

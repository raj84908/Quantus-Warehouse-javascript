## üìû Getting Help

### Common Issues

1. **"organizationId is required"**
   - You forgot to add organizationId to a query
   - Use `withAuth()` middleware (see `lib/auth-middleware-example.js`)

2. **"Slow queries"**
   - Check if indexes are created
   - Review `lib/query-optimization-examples.js`
   - Enable query logging in Prisma

3. **"Authentication not working"**
   - Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set
   - Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain
   - Check user exists in database

4. **"Migration failed"**
   - Backup database first
   - Review migration error
   - Use `npx prisma migrate reset` (DEVELOPMENT ONLY!)
